   - From the menu, hover over "More Tools," and then click on "Extensions."

   - In the Extensions page, you'll find a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" in the top-right corner of the page. Turn this switch on by clicking it. This action activates Developer Mode.

4. **Install the Extension:**
   - Once Developer Mode is enabled, you'll have access to additional options.
